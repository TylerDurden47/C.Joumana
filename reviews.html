            seriously the plan is amazing, I feel like Iâ€™m not deprived of
            anything in this diet itâ€™s balanced, satisfying, and I actually
            enjoy it

            Joumana, I just noticed something now and I really want to thank you
            for it. It might seem like a small thing, but it honestly surprised
            me ever since my chest alignment improved, I can actually see a
            clear difference! Iâ€™ve trained my chest so many times before, but
            this is the first time Iâ€™ve ever seen it change like this.

            thereâ€™s been huge progress and Iâ€™m really satisfied with the
            results. Honestly, you made such a great plan â€” Iâ€™ve trained with
            many coaches before, and I used to get bored of their routines, but
            this one is actually enjoyable and motivating

            Iâ€™m honestly so happy you canâ€™t imagine how I felt when I saw how I
            look now! It gave me such huge motivation. At first, I was just
            going to the gym to pass time, but now I actually want to keep going
            so I can see even better progress

            Even though we gained a bit of weight at the beginning of the month,
            at first I was lost and wasnâ€™t planning to go to the gym because I
            wanted my weight and build to be not suitable for the army
            requirements. But when I started with you even though I wasnâ€™t 100%
            consistent I saw really great results. So just imagine how things
            would be if I had been fully consistent! ðŸ’ª
